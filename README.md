## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This GitHub repo contains the lab materials for the [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices).

Start by following the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/Final_MLAI_Welcome.docx) to prepare your Azure environment and download the [labfiles](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/labs.zip) used in the lab exercises. Then complete the labs in the following order:

2. [Lab 1 - Working with Text and Speech](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/DAT263x-Lab2.pdf) - Here are the Lab 2 files [Lab1 files](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/Text%20and%20Speech.zip). In this lab, you'll learn how to analyze text and use Azure Cognitive Services to build AI solutions that apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
3. [Lab 2 - Working with Images and Video](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/DAT263x-Lab3.pdf) Here are the Lab 3 files: [Lab2 files](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/Vision.zip). In this lab you'll analyze images and build computer vision solutions using Azure Cognitive services.
4. [Lab 3 - Getting Started with Bots](https://github.com/annedroid/MLAI_CognitiveServices/blob/master/DAT263x-Lab4.pdf). In this lab you'll get started with Azure Bot Services, and build a simple conversational AI solution.
